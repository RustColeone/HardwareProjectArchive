# Hardware Project Archives
Projects related to hardware, arduino, will be stored here if I am no longer working on them. This doesn't mean that they are completed or dead. I might still come back in the future to edit them.
## Getting Started
I used PADs to draw some of the circuits so you might one to view or edit the file. I did included a PDF version if you would just want to take a quick look.

I might switch to another software in the future, so they might be different.
