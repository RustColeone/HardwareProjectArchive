# PiPortable
The idea is to fit a raspberry pi and things into a keyboard case. The arduino is used to copy the serial command out to the display that just happens to fit the calculator window.

For now I can only find the photos, I will upload the rest if I find them or if I decided to restart this project. However, whis time I am no longer obsessed with the calculator case, and I will possibly try to make it as good as possible. 

If I am to restart, I will make an announcement here in the future.
